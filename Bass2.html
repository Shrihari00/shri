    <p>The Brahmashirsha astra is the most destructive weapon described in the ancient Indian texts, capable to end the existence of gods or Devas. It is thought that the Brahmashirsha astra is superior than the Brahmastra, and causes chain reaction of massive explosions and waves to annihilate any desired entity of the Universe or even the Universe itself.
     The weapon manifests with the four heads of Lord Brahma as its tip. 
     Sage Agnivesa, Parshurama, Karna, Arjuna and Ashwatthama possessed the knowledge to invoke this weapon.This weapon can be invoked into any object, even to a blade of grass</p>
